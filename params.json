Not allot to show right now.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Sample Call**\r\n```bash\r\n$ ./netCalls.py -n sw01 -m arista -i veos-01 -f getDetails\r\nvendor:         arista\r\nplatform:       vEOS\r\nversion:        4.12.1-1581426.vEOS4125.1 (engineering build)\r\ncpu_utilization:    Cpu(s):  6.8%us\r\ntotal_sytem_memory:     1000444\r\nserial_number:      12345\r\nfree_system_memory:     59700\r\nhostname:       vEOS-1\r\nconnect_ip:         veos-01\r\nsystem_uptime:      4 days\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny serious discovery or outcome that happens here, will probably be ported over to [CPAL](https://github.com/jedelman8/cpal). Which is a collaboration of a few engineers to standarize network device communication through APIs.\r\n\r\nFollow my [BLOG](http://ipyandy.net) for more on networking, coding and rants.\r\nFollow me on [Twitter @IPyandy](http://twitter.com/IPyandy) and stay in touch.\r\n\r\nTo be updated soon","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
